# FractionalKnapsack
This project is built using HTML,CSS,JavaScript--which implement Fractional Knapsack Problem-Greedy Alrgorithm to find customized schedule based on User's Total Number of Tasks, Task Name, Approx time (in Minutes) in which a task can be completed, Priority of each task (1 being the Heighest), Total Time available to complete all the tasks.
(eg. I will be able to finish off XYZ subject in 20 minutes but it's priority is 5 since its weightage as per marks is low)
The output will be the ideal situation to be followed to achieve maximum output based on priority.
